<h2 align="center"><i>Create table with filter, remove, validation, async/await</i></h2>
<ul>
  <li>Filtering a table. Implement a filter on the table so that you can filter movies by their title, genre, year of release, or whether they were watched.</li>
  <li>Deleting a movie. Add a Delete button to each table row so that you can remove specific movies from the table.</li>
  <li>Deleting all movies. Add a "Delete All" button to allow you to delete all movies from the table.</li>
  <li>Film validation. Implement form validation to ensure that the title, genre, and release year fields are not empty before submitting. If validation fails, an appropriate error message must be shown.</li>
</ul>
